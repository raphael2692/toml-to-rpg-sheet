##### Class features

###### Sneak Attack (**3d6**)
> Once per turn, you can deal an extra 3d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

###### Thieves’ Cant
> You have learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly

###### Cunning Action
> You can take a bonus action on each of your turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

###### Fast Hands
> You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Sleight of Hand check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

###### Second-Story Work
> Climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by +3 feet.

###### Uncanny Dodge
> When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

##### Racial Traits

###### Lucky
> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

###### Brave
> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

###### Halfling Nimbleness
> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

###### Naturally Stealthy
> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
